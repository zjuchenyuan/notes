  + Directives (https://springismylove.wordpress.com/2015/09/03/derek-sivers-purge-the-vampires/):
    + HOW to be useful to others
      + Get Famous.
          Do everything in public and for the public.
          The more people you reach, the more useful you are.
          The opposite is hiding, which is of no use to anyone.
      + Get rich.
          Money is neutral proof that you are adding value to people's life.
          By getting rich, you are being useful as a side effect.
          Once rich, spend the money in ways that are even more useful to others.
          Then, getting rich is double useful.
      + Share strong opinions.
          Strong opinions are very useful to others.
          Those who are undecided or ambivalent can just adopt your stance.
          Those who disagree can solidify their stance by arguing against yours.
          Even if you invent an opinion for the sole sake of argument boldlly sharing a strong opinion is very useful to others.
      + Be Expensive.
          People given a placebo pill, are twice as likely to have their pain disappeared when told the pill is expensive.
          People who pay more for a ticket, are more likely to attend  performance.
          People who pay more for a value or service, value it more and get more use out of it.
    + How to thrive in an unknowable future 1:35
      + Prepare for the worst.
      + Expect disaster.
      + Own as little as possible.
      + Choose opportunity, not loyalty.
      + Choose the plan with the most options.
      + Avoid planning.
    + How to stop being rich and happy
      + Prioritize lifestyle design.
