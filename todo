Ask HN: How do I start being a consultant?
tptacek 1521 days ago | parent | favorite | on: Ask HN: How do I start being a consultant?

(1) Start a freelance practice.
(2) Raise your rates.
(3) As you work for clients, keep a sharp eye for opportunities to build "specialty practices". If you get to work on a project involving Mongodb, spend some extra time and effort to get Mongodb under your belt. If you get a project for a law firm, spend some extra time thinking about how to develop applications that deal with contracts or boilerplates or PDF generation or document management.
(4) Raise your rates.
(5) Start refusing hourly-rate projects. Your new minimum billable increment is a day.
(6) Take end-to-end responsibility for the business objectives of whatever you build. This sounds fuzzy, like, "be able to talk in a board room", but it isn't! It's mechanically simple and you can do it immediately: Stop counting hours and days. Stop pushing back when your client changes scope. Your remedy for clients who abuse your flexibility with regards to scope is "stop working with that client". Some of your best clients will be abusive and you won't have that remedy. Oh well! Note: you are now a consultant.
(7) Hire one person at a reasonable salary. You are now responsible for their payroll and benefits. If you don't book enough work to pay both your take-home and their salary, you don't eat. In return: they don't get an automatic percentage of all the revenue of the company, nor does their salary automatically scale with your bill rate.
(8) You are now "senior" or "principal". Raise your rates.
(9) Generalize out from your specialties: Mongodb -> NoSQL -> highly scalable backends. Document management -> secure contract management.
(10) Raise your rates.
(11) You are now a top-tier consulting group compared to most of the market. Market yourself as such. Also: your rates are too low by probably about 40-60%.
Try to get it through your head: people who can simultaneously (a) crank out code (or arrange to have code cranked out) and (b) take responsibility for the business outcome of the problems that code is supposed to solve --- people who can speak both tech and biz --- are exceptionally rare. They shouldn't be; the language of business is mostly just elementary customer service, of the kind taught to entry level clerks at Nordstrom's. But they are, so if you can do that, raise your rates.

# Recommended Resources for Learning AI - ALL FREE
(from https://medium.com/open-intelligence/recommended-resources-for-learning-ai-3ab4023cfa85#.6spl6f6if)

# Classes that everyone is taking:
  + Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) /// Class notes: (http://holehouse.org/mlclass/index.html)
  + Yaser Abu-Mostafa’s Machine Learning course which focuses much more on theory than the Coursera class but it is still relevant for beginners.(https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)
  + Probabilistic Graphical Models (https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models)
  + Computational Neuroscience (https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience)

#From Open AI CEO Greg Brockman on Quora:
  + Deep Learning Book (http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
    It contains essentially all the concepts and intuition needed for deep learning engineering (except reinforcement learning).

# Courses:
  + Linear Algebra — Stephen Boyd’s EE263 (Stanford) (http://ee263.stanford.edu/) or Linear Algebra (MIT)(http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm)
  + Neural Networks for Machine Learning — Geoff Hinton (Coursera) https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks
  + Neural Nets — Andrej Karpathy’s CS231N (Stanford) http://cs231n.stanford.edu/
  + Advanced Robotics (the MDP / optimal control lectures) — Pieter Abbeel’s CS287 (Berkeley) https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa11/
  + Deep RL — John Schulman’s CS294–112 (Berkeley) http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/

# From Director of AI Research at Facebook and Professor at NYU Yann LeCun on Quora:
  + In any case, take Calc I, Calc II, Calc III, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, and as many physics courses as you can. But make sure you learn to program.

----------
Here's a tentative plan-
1. Do fully AndrewNg's course from Coursera
2. Do a course called AnalyticsEdge by MIT folks from edx.org. I can't recommend this course highly enough. It's a gem. You will learn practical stuff like RoC curves, and what not. Note that for a few things you will need to google and read on your own as the course might just give you an overview.
3. Keep the book "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie handy. You will need to refer this book a lot.

4. There is also a course that Professor Hastie runs but I don't know the link for it. I highly recommend it as it gives a very good grounding on things like GBM, which are used a lot in practical scenarios.
5. Pick up twitter/enron emails/product reviews datasets and do sentiment analysis on it.
6. Pick up a lot of documents on some topic and make a program for automatically producing a summary of those documents - first read some papers on it.
7. Don't do Kaggle. It's something you do when you have considerable expertise with ML/AI.
8. Pick up flights data and do prediction for flight delays. Use different algorithms, compare them.
9. Make a recommendation system to recommend books/music/movies (or all).
10. Make a Neural Network to predict moves in a tic-tac-toe game.
These are a few things that can get you started. This is vast field but once you've done the above in earnest I think you have a good grounding.
Pick a topic that interests you and write a paper on it - it's not such a big deal.

I just started the Coursera Machine Learning course. I know that it's probably a bit under your skill level, but the second half of the class might give you some broad education about what's possible in the field of machine learning. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/

After taking Andrew Ngs course I highly recommend you take cs231n afterwards.
Assuming you know a little bit of calculus you'll be able to create and train fully connected networks, convolution networks, recurrent networks, and long short term memory networks using only numpy. You will feel very comfortable with deep learning after taking this class.

The lecture videos for the course got taken down due to complaints, but you can recover them via google

      + HOW to be useful to others
        + Get Famous.
            Do everything in public and for the public.
            The more people you reach, the more useful you are.
            The opposite is hiding, which is of no use to anyone.
        + Get rich.
            Money is neutral proof that you are adding value to people's life.
            By getting rich, you are being useful as a side effect.
            Once rich, spend the money in ways that are even more useful to others.
            Then, getting rich is double useful.
        + Share strong opinions.
            Strong opinions are very useful to others.
            Those who are undecided or ambivalent can just adopt your stance.
            Those who disagree can solidify their stance by arguing against yours.
            Even if you invent an opinion for the sole sake of argument boldlly sharing a strong opinion is very useful to others.
        + Be Expensive.
            People given a placebo pill, are twice as likely to have their pain disappeared when told the pill is expensive.
            People who pay more for a ticket, are more likely to attend  performance.
            People who pay more for a value or service, value it more and get more use out of it.

++++  42 by Douglas Adams
1. “A learning experience is one of those things that says, 'You know that thing you just did? Don't do that.’”
2. “I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.”
3. “Let's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.”
4. “The quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead.”
5 “I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don't know the answer.”
6. “It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.”
7. “All opinions are not equal. Some are a very great deal more robust, sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others.”
8. “I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.”
9. “The idea was fantastically, wildly improbable. But like most fantastically, wildly improbable ideas it was at least as worthy of consideration as a more mundane one to which the facts had been strenuously bent to fit.”
10. “I'd far rather be happy than right any day.”
11. “Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasn't developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we don't expect to see.”
12. “Reality is frequently inaccurate.”
13. “What I need... is a strong drink and a peer group.”
14. “It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of their own eyes and ears.”
15. “There is no point in using the word 'impossible' to describe something that has clearly happened.”
16. “One is never alone with a rubber duck.”
17. “Beethoven tells you what it's like to be Beethoven and Mozart tells you what it's like to be human. Bach tells you what it's like to be the universe.”
18. “Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else that thinks at least as logically as it does.”
19. “Let the past hold on to itself and let the present move forward into the future.”
20. “I don't accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view.”
21. “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”
22. “The impossible often has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks.”
23. “Life is wasted on the living.”
24. “There are some people you like immediately, some whom you think you might learn to like in the fullness of time, and some that you simply want to push away from you with a sharp stick.”
25. “I'd take the awe of understanding over the awe of ignorance any day.”
26. “All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the first place.”
27. “Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”
28. “A life that is burdened with expectations is a heavy life. Its fruit is sorrow and disappointment.”
29. “If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat.”
30. “People who need to bully you are the easiest to push around.”
31. “We have normality. I repeat, we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem.”
32. “Beauty doesn't have to be about anything. What's a vase about? What's a sunset or a flower about? What, for that matter, is Mozart's Twenty-third Piano Concerto about?”
33. “Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.”
34. “Even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.”
35. “My universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay.”
36. “If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands.”
37. “A cup of tea would restore my normality.”
38. “Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.”
39. “It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point of view without the proper training.”
40. “You live and learn. At any rate, you live.”
41. “Don't believe anything you read on the net. Except this. Well, including this, I suppose.”
42. “Don't Panic.”

Mastering Programming

KENT BECK·TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 2016
From years of watching master programmers, I have observed certain common patterns in their workflows. From years of coaching skilled journeyman programmers, I have observed the absence of those patterns. I have seen what a difference introducing the patterns can make.
Here are ways effective programmers get the most out of their precious 3e9 seconds on the planet.
The theme here is scaling your brain. The journeyman learns to solve bigger problems by solving more problems at once. The master learns to solve even bigger problems than that by solving fewer problems at once. Part of the wisdom is subdividing so that integrating the separate solutions will be a smaller problem than just solving them together.


Time

Slicing.
Take a big project, cut it into thin slices, and rearrange the slices to suit your context. I can always slice projects finer and I can always find new permutations of the slices that meet different needs.

One thing at a time.
We’re so focused on efficiency that we reduce the number of feedback cycles in an attempt to reduce overhead. This leads to difficult debugging situations whose expected cost is greater than the cycle overhead we avoided.

Make it run, make it right, make it fast.
(Example of One Thing at a Time, Slicing, and Easy Changes)

Easy changes.
When faced with a hard change, first make it easy (warning, this may be hard), then make the easy change. (e.g. slicing, one thing at a time, concentration, isolation). Example of slicing.

Concentration.
If you need to change several elements, first rearrange the code so the change only needs to happen in one element.

Isolation.
If you only need to change a part of an element, extract that part so the whole subelement changes.

Baseline Measurement.
Start projects by measuring the current state of the world. This goes against our engineering instincts to start fixing things, but when you measure the baseline you will actually know whether you are fixing things.


Learning

Call your shot.
Before you run code, predict out loud exactly what will happen.

Concrete hypotheses.
When the program is misbehaving, articulate exactly what you think is wrong before making a change. If you have two or more hypotheses, find a differential diagnosis.

Remove extraneous detail.
When reporting a bug, find the shortest repro steps. When isolating a bug, find the shortest test case. When using a new API, start from the most basic example. “All that stuff can’t possibly matter,” is an expensive assumption when it’s wrong.
E.g. see a bug on mobile, reproduce it with curl

Multiple scales.
Move between scales freely. Maybe this is a design problem, not a testing problem. Maybe it is a people problem, not a technology problem [cheating, this is always true].


Transcend Logic

Symmetry.
Things that are almost the same can be divided into parts that are identical and parts that are clearly different.

Aesthetics.
Beauty if a powerful gradient to climb. It is also a liberating gradient to flout (e.g. inlining a bunch of functions into one giant mess).

Rhythm.
Waiting until the right moment preserves energy and avoids clutter. Act with intensity when the time comes to act.

Tradeoffs.
All decisions are subject to tradeoffs. It’s more important to know what the decision depends on than it is to know which answer to pick today (or which answer you picked yesterday).


Risk

Fun list.
When tangential ideas come, note them and get back to work quickly. Revisit this list when you’ve reached a stopping spot.

Feed Ideas.
Ideas are like frightened little birds. If you scare them away they will stop coming around. When you have an idea, feed it a little. Invalidate it as quickly as you can, but from data not from a lack of self-esteem.

80/15/5.
Spend 80% of your time on low-risk/reasonable-payoff work. Spend 15% of your time on related high-risk/high-payoff work. Spend 5% of your time on things that tickle you, regardless of payoff. Teach the next generation to do your 80% job. By the time someone is ready to take over, one of your 15% experiments (or, less frequently, one of your 5% experiments) will have paid off and will become your new 80%. Repeat.


Conclusion

The flow in this outline seems to be from reducing risks by managing time and increasing learning to mindfully taking risks by using your whole brain and quickly triaging ideas.


---------------------------------

Python

Learn the Basics - Variables, Control Structures, Data Structures, Syntax, Tools
Practice what you learnt on sites like Codecademy
Take the course - MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
Get familiar with Python Libraries
Learn how to scrape websites and scrape the whole internet, anything and everything possible you can think off without going to jail
Research about Machine Learning
Start solving your day to day problems with python. So, if you are doing something over and over manually think how you can automate it.
Time to take your skills to next level - Learn Data Structure and Algorithms
Learn about Frameworks like Django, Flask etc and create a website for yourself.
Work on projects that interest you and learn as you go.
Below is a list of video resources that I found useful while learning python programming. These resources are targeted towards Beginner to Intermediate level programmers.

Python Tutor
http://www.pythontutor.com ( Free )

I highly recommend this tool to everybody, whether you are trying to learn Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, or C++ . It will help you visualize what the computer is doing step-by-step as it executes those programs.

Bucky Roberts
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_ ( Free )

If you are completely new to programming, Bucky Robert’s Tutorials are a good place to start. They are simple and easy to follow. Once you start feeling comfortable, you can move on to other resources.

Corey Schafer
https://www.youtube.com/playlist... ( Free )
https://www.youtube.com/playlist... ( Free )

Corey has good videos on String Formatting, Generators, Comprehensions, Programming Terms [ Mutable vs Immutable, DRY, Memoization, Idempotence, Combinations and Permutations, String Interpolation, First Class Functions, Closures ] etc and he does a good job explaining the concepts.

Derek Banas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... ( Free )

Derek Banas is a self taught programmer. He has a different teaching style, where he will make a video on particular programming language usually 45 -60 minutes in length that will cover 80% of what you need to know regarding that language.

Edx
MITx: 6.00.1x – Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
https://www.edx.org/course/intro... ( Free )

This is one of the best course that I have taken so far, not only you will learn lots of python but also important computer science concepts such Algorithms, Recursion, Debugging, Assertions and Exceptions, Efficiency and Orders of Growth, Object Oriented Programming, Trees. This course is taught by MIT Professor Eric Grimson and covers the same material which is taught in class at MIT for course 6.00 – Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python by John Guttag. However at edX they divided the original MIT 6.00 course into two parts. MITx: 6.00.1x and MITx:6.00.2x.

MITx: 6.00.2x – Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
https://www.edx.org/course/intro... ( Free )

This course builds on where MITx 6.00.1x left off. So, knowledge equivalent to 6.00.1x or some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity is required. This course is taught by John Guttag and topics covered are Plotting with the pylab package, Random walks, Probability, Distributions, Monte Carlo simulations, Curve fitting, Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization, Machine learning basics, Clustering algorithms, Statistical fallacies

Codecademy
https://www.codecademy.com/learn... ( Free )

They say it takes 10,000 hours of coding to become a good programmer. Whether that is True or Not, Codecademy is a good place to get practice on your newly acquired skills whether they are Python, Ruby, Html & CSS, Javascript, Ajax, JQuery etc.

Udacity
https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science–cs101 ( Free )

This course is taught by Dave Evans. He is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia where he teaches computer science and leads research in computer security. He is the author of an Introduction to Computing Explorations in Language, Logic, and Machines and has won Virginia’s highest award for university faculty. He has PhD, SM, and SB degrees from MIT.

https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python–ud036 ( Free )

By now you should have enough knowledge and confidence to write small to medium size programs and now you know more than what “Mark Zuckerberg” knew when he started Facebook. Now it’s time to think out the box and think BIG. Time to start your own startup and be an Entrepreneur. Get basic idea on How to Start a Startup - Standford University. Start researching about technology stack used by all major companies Quora, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Pinterest, Instagram, Dropbox etc to get basic idea what they are using and whats in trend. After doing all this, now you should feel that you are not even a drop in the bucket. Keep learning till you get Rich or Die Trying because you only have one life to live. You can either live it driving a KIA and living paycheck to paycheck or you could be driving a Lamborghini and living in a mansion. Always remember there is nothing more dangerous than a motivated person.

+ What are some things you wish you knew when you started programming?

Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming
Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.
Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)
Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.
Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

1. You learn by doing. The only way to get better at programming is to actually program. Don’t let an analysis paralysis prevent you from ever starting.

2. Programming isn’t like studying for a test. Memorizing stuff doesn’t matter all that much.

3. Cheating is completely acceptable. I use Google to solve most of my problems, and so do most programmers.

4. Letting problems pile up without checking is a poor strategy. I used to make endless changes to my code and expect it to work right away. The problem with this approach is that it stacks one problem on top of another, and it becomes difficult to figure what went wrong.

5. Learning by yourself is really tough. Talking about code and collaborating with other aspiring developers is a better way to learn for most people.

6. Let go of your emotions. You’re going to see error messages on your journey to becoming a programmer. When screwing up is such an integral part of the process, you need to be ok with making mistakes in order to grow.

7. You don’t need 5 monitors. Contrary to what Hollywood might tell you, you don’t need an insane external monitor setup to be a programmer. The computer that you own right now is probably good enough to use to start programming. Don’t waste your money.

8. There’s a BIG difference between a capital letter and a lowercase letter. It took me a while to get used to noticing subtle differences between similar symbols, and it can be pretty frustrating until you get used to it.

9. Trying to understand everything is a lost cause. In the beginning, I tried to chase down the “why” to every problem I encountered. This isn’t necessary. Computers are so complex and there is so much to learn, and you’re never going to understand everything. That’s ok.

10. Pair program as much as possible. There is no faster way to learn how to code.

11. Changing bad code is part of the process. I used to think that every piece of code I wrote needed to be perfect. But making improvements to your code is normal. You’re not writing a book that can’t be changed once it’s published.

12. There’s a right way to ask for help. Everybody needs to ask for help at some point. And when you do, make sure that you do these 4 things:

Overcommunicate details that you see.
Explain exactly what you think should be happening.
Explain exactly what is actually happening.
Explain why you think it should be working differently.
When you go through this process, you’ll often come across a solution without ever asking for help. It makes you think about problems in a holistic way.

13. You don’t need to be a math genius. If you’re not a “math person,” that doesn’t mean that you can’t be a programmer.

14. Always celebrate the small wins. Building stuff with code is really cool. I never would have arrived where I’m at if I hadn’t stepped back and admired the awesome things I was building along the way.

15. Meet-ups are incredibly valuable. In the beginning, it was pretty intimidating to get myself to the point where I felt comfortable attending these. But once I did, I realized that there were a ton of developers just like me.

16. Avoiding merge conflicts makes you happier. Merge conflicts are annoying. So when I realized that I could sneak a feature in before a teammate so that he/she had to deal with these instead of me, I was super excited.

17. It’s ok to admit what you don’t know. When you land your first programming job, you might be inclined to “fake it till you make it.” Don’t. Nobody expects you to know everything right away.

18. It doesn’t take 10,000 hours to be good enough to land a job. In reality, you need to be good enough to know how to self correct and get back on track when problems arise. This takes far less time than 10,000 hours.

19. You’re going to wake up in the morning thinking about code. And when it happens, it’s really freakin’ cool.

20. It’s ok to make big mistakes. I once made a mistake that cost my company $10,000 dollars. In the process, I learned the most important lesson of my programming career.

21. An algorithm is like finding a name in a phonebook. Algorithms are a step-by-step approach where there is exactly one correct next step. An easier way to think about this is the strategy that you would take to find one specific name in a phonebook.

22. You’re never going to feel like you’re ready to program full time. Imposter syndrome is real. Try to remember that it’s normal to not know everything. The most important thing is understanding that you can figure out the stuff that you don’t know.

23. Programmers never stop learning. New technologies come out all the time, so the programmers that succeed are the ones who continue to learn and develop their craft on an ongoing basis.

24. Make the computer think like a human. Too many people have the impression that you need to think like a computer. It’s actually the opposite.

25. Programming is about using the right tool for the job. There are so many different open source libraries, tools, and frameworks at your disposal. So you need to grow your developer toolkit and understand which tool makes sense for each problem that they encounter.

26. It’s common to give up right before change is about to happen. Learning to code (especially to the point where you can switch careers) is a lot of work. It takes time and a lot of discipline, but it is possible. Too many people make the mistake of doing almost enough work to to get where they want.

27. Learning to code isn’t easy. But that’s why it’s worth doing.
