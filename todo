Ask HN: From programming to AI, how?
vaibkv 1 hour ago

Here's a tentative plan- 1. Do fully AndrewNg's course from Coursera
2. Do a course called AnalyticsEdge by MIT folks from edx.org. I can't recommend this course highly enough. It's a gem. You will learn practical stuff like RoC curves, and what not. Note that for a few things you will need to google and read on your own as the course might just give you an overview.
3. Keep the book "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie handy. You will need to refer this book a lot.
4. There is also a course that Professor Hastie runs but I don't know the link for it. I highly recommend it as it gives a very good grounding on things like GBM, which are used a lot in practical scenarios.
5. Pick up twitter/enron emails/product reviews datasets and do sentiment analysis on it.
6. Pick up a lot of documents on some topic and make a program for automatically producing a summary of those documents - first read some papers on it.
7. Don't do Kaggle. It's something you do when you have considerable expertise with ML/AI.
8. Pick up flights data and do prediction for flight delays. Use different algorithms, compare them.
9. Make a recommendation system to recommend books/music/movies (or all).
10. Make a Neural Network to predict moves in a tic-tac-toe game.
These are a few things that can get you started. This is vast field but once you've done the above in earnest I think you have a good grounding.
Pick a topic that interests you and write a paper on it - it's not such a big deal.

I just started the Coursera Machine Learning course. I know that it's probably a bit under your skill level, but the second half of the class might give you some broad education about what's possible in the field of machine learning. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/

After taking Andrew Ngs course I highly recommend you take cs231n afterwards.
Assuming you know a little bit of calculus you'll be able to create and train fully connected networks, convolution networks, recurrent networks, and long short term memory networks using only numpy. You will feel very comfortable with deep learning after taking this class.

The lecture videos for the course got taken down due to complaints, but you can recover them via google

      + HOW to be useful to others
        + Get Famous.
            Do everything in public and for the public.
            The more people you reach, the more useful you are.
            The opposite is hiding, which is of no use to anyone.
        + Get rich.
            Money is neutral proof that you are adding value to people's life.
            By getting rich, you are being useful as a side effect.
            Once rich, spend the money in ways that are even more useful to others.
            Then, getting rich is double useful.
        + Share strong opinions.
            Strong opinions are very useful to others.
            Those who are undecided or ambivalent can just adopt your stance.
            Those who disagree can solidify their stance by arguing against yours.
            Even if you invent an opinion for the sole sake of argument boldlly sharing a strong opinion is very useful to others.
        + Be Expensive.
            People given a placebo pill, are twice as likely to have their pain disappeared when told the pill is expensive.
            People who pay more for a ticket, are more likely to attend  performance.
            People who pay more for a value or service, value it more and get more use out of it.

++++  42 by Douglas Adams
1. “A learning experience is one of those things that says, 'You know that thing you just did? Don't do that.’”
2. “I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.”
3. “Let's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all.”
4. “The quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead.”
5 “I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don't know the answer.”
6. “It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.”
7. “All opinions are not equal. Some are a very great deal more robust, sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others.”
8. “I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.”
9. “The idea was fantastically, wildly improbable. But like most fantastically, wildly improbable ideas it was at least as worthy of consideration as a more mundane one to which the facts had been strenuously bent to fit.”
10. “I'd far rather be happy than right any day.”
11. “Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasn't developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we don't expect to see.”
12. “Reality is frequently inaccurate.”
13. “What I need... is a strong drink and a peer group.”
14. “It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of their own eyes and ears.”
15. “There is no point in using the word 'impossible' to describe something that has clearly happened.”
16. “One is never alone with a rubber duck.”
17. “Beethoven tells you what it's like to be Beethoven and Mozart tells you what it's like to be human. Bach tells you what it's like to be the universe.”
18. “Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else that thinks at least as logically as it does.”
19. “Let the past hold on to itself and let the present move forward into the future.”
20. “I don't accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view.”
21. “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”
22. “The impossible often has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks.”
23. “Life is wasted on the living.”
24. “There are some people you like immediately, some whom you think you might learn to like in the fullness of time, and some that you simply want to push away from you with a sharp stick.”
25. “I'd take the awe of understanding over the awe of ignorance any day.”
26. “All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the first place.”
27. “Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”
28. “A life that is burdened with expectations is a heavy life. Its fruit is sorrow and disappointment.”
29. “If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat.”
30. “People who need to bully you are the easiest to push around.”
31. “We have normality. I repeat, we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem.”
32. “Beauty doesn't have to be about anything. What's a vase about? What's a sunset or a flower about? What, for that matter, is Mozart's Twenty-third Piano Concerto about?”
33. “Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.”
34. “Even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.”
35. “My universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay.”
36. “If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands.”
37. “A cup of tea would restore my normality.”
38. “Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.”
39. “It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point of view without the proper training.”
40. “You live and learn. At any rate, you live.”
41. “Don't believe anything you read on the net. Except this. Well, including this, I suppose.”
42. “Don't Panic.”

Mastering Programming

KENT BECK·TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 2016
From years of watching master programmers, I have observed certain common patterns in their workflows. From years of coaching skilled journeyman programmers, I have observed the absence of those patterns. I have seen what a difference introducing the patterns can make.
Here are ways effective programmers get the most out of their precious 3e9 seconds on the planet.
The theme here is scaling your brain. The journeyman learns to solve bigger problems by solving more problems at once. The master learns to solve even bigger problems than that by solving fewer problems at once. Part of the wisdom is subdividing so that integrating the separate solutions will be a smaller problem than just solving them together.


Time

Slicing.
Take a big project, cut it into thin slices, and rearrange the slices to suit your context. I can always slice projects finer and I can always find new permutations of the slices that meet different needs.

One thing at a time.
We’re so focused on efficiency that we reduce the number of feedback cycles in an attempt to reduce overhead. This leads to difficult debugging situations whose expected cost is greater than the cycle overhead we avoided.

Make it run, make it right, make it fast.
(Example of One Thing at a Time, Slicing, and Easy Changes)

Easy changes.
When faced with a hard change, first make it easy (warning, this may be hard), then make the easy change. (e.g. slicing, one thing at a time, concentration, isolation). Example of slicing.

Concentration.
If you need to change several elements, first rearrange the code so the change only needs to happen in one element.

Isolation.
If you only need to change a part of an element, extract that part so the whole subelement changes.

Baseline Measurement.
Start projects by measuring the current state of the world. This goes against our engineering instincts to start fixing things, but when you measure the baseline you will actually know whether you are fixing things.


Learning

Call your shot.
Before you run code, predict out loud exactly what will happen.

Concrete hypotheses.
When the program is misbehaving, articulate exactly what you think is wrong before making a change. If you have two or more hypotheses, find a differential diagnosis.

Remove extraneous detail.
When reporting a bug, find the shortest repro steps. When isolating a bug, find the shortest test case. When using a new API, start from the most basic example. “All that stuff can’t possibly matter,” is an expensive assumption when it’s wrong.
E.g. see a bug on mobile, reproduce it with curl

Multiple scales.
Move between scales freely. Maybe this is a design problem, not a testing problem. Maybe it is a people problem, not a technology problem [cheating, this is always true].


Transcend Logic

Symmetry.
Things that are almost the same can be divided into parts that are identical and parts that are clearly different.

Aesthetics.
Beauty if a powerful gradient to climb. It is also a liberating gradient to flout (e.g. inlining a bunch of functions into one giant mess).

Rhythm.
Waiting until the right moment preserves energy and avoids clutter. Act with intensity when the time comes to act.

Tradeoffs.
All decisions are subject to tradeoffs. It’s more important to know what the decision depends on than it is to know which answer to pick today (or which answer you picked yesterday).


Risk

Fun list.
When tangential ideas come, note them and get back to work quickly. Revisit this list when you’ve reached a stopping spot.

Feed Ideas.
Ideas are like frightened little birds. If you scare them away they will stop coming around. When you have an idea, feed it a little. Invalidate it as quickly as you can, but from data not from a lack of self-esteem.

80/15/5.
Spend 80% of your time on low-risk/reasonable-payoff work. Spend 15% of your time on related high-risk/high-payoff work. Spend 5% of your time on things that tickle you, regardless of payoff. Teach the next generation to do your 80% job. By the time someone is ready to take over, one of your 15% experiments (or, less frequently, one of your 5% experiments) will have paid off and will become your new 80%. Repeat.


Conclusion

The flow in this outline seems to be from reducing risks by managing time and increasing learning to mindfully taking risks by using your whole brain and quickly triaging ideas.
